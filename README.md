###### Tic-Tac-Toe instructions / How to play / Rules ######

 * Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.
 * Player move is permanent and can't be moved again. If a position is taken you can not overwrite it.
 * The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
 * If no move is available, then it's a tie.

 * After choosing a name, Player 1 (X) will start.
* Press 1 - 9 to place your move in the 3 x 3 grid that will show on screen.
  * <br>![Numbered grid][numbers-grid]
* After game ends, press y or n to continue or exit.
* You can force a break in the loop by typing -5 as an input.
